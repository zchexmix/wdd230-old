            <h2 class="principle">Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Netflix</h3>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">

            </a>    
            <p>With visual hierarchy, It is critical to have the most important pieces of informatiomn be the first thing that your customers see. Where you want them to look needs to be the most encapsulating item on the screen. Netflix does this brilliantly. The first thing they want you do to is sign up. There are to ads or promotional things on what options they might have to sell you. In order for you to see whats available they directly place the sign up option right in front of you, in the middle of the screen.</p>

            <h2 class="principle">Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Nike</h3>
            <a href="https://www.nike.com" target="blank">
        
                <img id="rulethirds" src="images/RuleOfThirds.png" alt="Nike Home Page">
            </a>
            
            <p>The rule of thirds is something most major companies practice and is something all companies should implement. It is the organization of your content into a grid of thirds. It also works the same way in photography. When you have the grid turned on on your phone camera, it is wise to place items each in a different third of the screen. So it is with a website. This will make it easier for your customers to consume the information on your site.</p>

            <h2 class="principle">White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" target="blank">
                <img id="whitespace" src="images/WhiteSpaceCleanDesign.png">
            </a>
            <p>The King of whitespace and clean design is of course, Apple. They are known for their sleek simple designs and they emplify that in their web page design. Through this picture you can see how much whitespace is included. It may feel empty while building it but it gives it such a ckean and powerful look. They have a simple ad for the product, how much it costs in a couplke of lines, and a large image of the device they are selling. It's simple yet powerful and can be a great way to build out a webpage.</p>
